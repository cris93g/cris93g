Hi, I'm Cristian ðŸ‘‹

I'm from Dallas, TX striving to innovate great solutions to modern-day problems. I specialize in development, but any activity requiring problem solving and creative thinking is where you will find me.

Currently contracted as a Application Developer @ Teksystems, and working on personal projects in my spare time.

~ I wish I did more open source work, and I'll try my best to get more into it in the near future.

ðŸ“§ Email if I can help out with anthing Christiandevwork@gmail.com
